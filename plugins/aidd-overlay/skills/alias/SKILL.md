name: alias
model: sonnet
description: Fires a pre-crafted workflow prompt to chain aidd skills in one command, or rewrite a prompt file in place (smarten). Use when you want to trigger plan→challenge or implement→review sequences, project snapshot with status context (previously), or compress a .md prompt to its minimal form (smarten). Do NOT use for single-skill tasks, custom workflows, or when you need direct control over each step.

# Alias

Expands a short command into a well-crafted, pre-authored prompt that chains aidd skills. Each alias carries the exact instruction sequence for a recurring workflow — call it once, it fires the right prompt.

## Available actions

| #   | Action        | Role                                                                           | Input                        |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 01  | `rechallenge` | Plan the current task, then challenge until 0 deal-breakers and 0 suggestions  | current task in context      |
| 02  | `afterdev`    | Implement from the current plan, then run both reviews                         | current plan in context      |
| 03  | `endtask`     | Commit → endplan → changelog → push tags → close issue                         | current branch + issue number   |
| 04  | `endplan`     | Archive plan file → capture learnings → merge branch if applicable → push      | current branch in context       |
| 05  | `bump-plugin` | Bump plugin version in plugin.json + index.json → commit → push marketplace    | plugin name + version or bump type |
| 06  | `previously`  | Project snapshot with status context — status summary + tests/git/lint snapshot | optional depth (commit count or duration like 7d) |
| 07  | `smarten`     | Rewrite a prompt file in place — remove fluff, compress steps, bullet points    | file path |

## Default flow

Trigger-to-action mapping:

- "plan and challenge", "plan then challenge", "alias rechallenge", "rechallenge", "challenge the plan in a loop", "plan with challenge" → `rechallenge`
- "implement and review", "implement then review", "alias afterdev", "afterdev", "implement with double review" → `afterdev`
- "end task", "close task", "endtask", "alias endtask", "commit and release", "wrap up this task", "finish the task" → `endtask`
- "end plan", "close plan", "endplan", "alias endplan", "merge the plan branch", "archive the plan", "finish the plan branch" → `endplan`
- "bump plugin", "release plugin", "bump-plugin", "alias bump-plugin", "monter en version", "bumper le plugin", "release <plugin>" → `bump-plugin`
- "where are we in the project", "catch me up", "what's the current project state", "project snapshot", "previously", "alias previously" → `previously`
- "smarten", "slim this", "simplify this prompt", "optimize this prompt", "compress this file", "alias smarten" → `smarten`

## Transversal rules

- Execute the pre-crafted prompt verbatim — do not paraphrase, summarize, or reorder steps.
- No user confirmation is needed between steps unless the action explicitly requires it.
- If the required context (task description, plan file) is missing, ask for it before firing.
